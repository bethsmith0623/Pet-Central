# *__Pet Central__*

Do you struggle with keeping track of details for your non-human babies? Would you like your pet care information all in one convenient place? Then Pet Central for you! Whether your pets are furry, feathered or scaled, this app helps you keep all your important information in one location. You can add your pet's health conditions, medications, and vaccinations and update this information as needed. You can even delete your pet if they are adopted by someone else or cross the rainbow bridge. You can also add or update details for a variety of pet care providers such as veterinarians, groomers, trainers, and more. Link a new or existing provider to each pet you enter. And don't forget to delete those providers that don't love your pet as much as you do!
