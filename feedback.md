Excellent job on this project. It's more than clear your hard work has paid off! I think you could have done A little extra on the models themselves. I feel like there were some great opportunities to user the 'enum' validators within your models. On that note, I didn't see any default values assigned either, which can be beneficial in regards to data integrity. Again, amazing project which has left me with nothing more to talk about other than your models. 

To quantify what you did well, I thought the over all the functionality of your application was more than flushed out. Your app truly felt like it was doing a lot of work by providing a service. I thought the styles of the page, once you signed in, was elegant and professional. In addition you created a great navbar that looks stunning on the web. Phenomenal job Beth!
